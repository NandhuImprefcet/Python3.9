There are two differnt types of Exceptions
in python on the basis of Exception class provides
1. Pre-defined Exception (in-built Exception)
2. User-defined Exception (cusormized/derived Exception)



The exception which is implicitly raised from PVM
is handled by pre-defined Exception.



We can create our own Exception by defining Exception classes,
and explicitly raising that Exception.
